Here are the math questions from the text: 

1. Suppose the function g(x) = x + 2 / x -3 is one-to-one, find the inverse g−1(x).

2. If f is a one-to-one function with f(0) = 7 and f ′(0) = 3, find d/dxf −1(7) given [f −1(a)]′ = [f ′(f −1(a))]^−1.

3. A bacteria culture initially contains 100 cells and grows at a rate proportional to its size. After an hour the population has increased. Write down the solution of the differential equation dy/dt = ky, y(0) = y0 and then find the relative growth rate, k, of the bacteria population based on the given information.

4. Use the Product Rule to find the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x) ln(x^2 + 1).

5. Apply the definition of the derivative: f ′(a) = lim (x → a) [f(x) - f(a)] / (x - a) to evaluate the limit lim (x → 0) [ln (1 + 2x) / x]. Then choose the correct answer among the given choices.

6. Use the Quotient Rule to find the f ′(x) if f(x) = e^x / 1 + e^x.

7. Use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative of: (x + 1)^4 / (x -3)^8.

8. Use u-substitution to find the antiderivative: ∫ ln(1 + 2x) / (2x + 1) dx.

9. Evaluate the definite integral: ∫ (1/2 to 1/4) e^1/x / x^2 dx.

10. Determine the horizontal asymptotes of the function f(x) = e^2x - e^x / e^2x + 1. Then choose the correct answer among the given choices.
