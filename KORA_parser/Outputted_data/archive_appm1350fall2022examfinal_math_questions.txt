2. (12 pts) (a) State the definition of continuity of a function, f(x), at a point, x = a (b) Now consider the function f(x) defined on [−1, 1] by f(x) = {2 sin^−1(x) if x < 1/2, c if x = 1/2, 2 cos^−1(x) if x > 1/2} Is there a value of c that makes f continuous at x = 1/2? Justify your answer using the definition of continuity.

3. (18 pts) Consider the function h(x) = 2√x −1 (a) Locate all local extrema of h(x). Clearly indicate which x-coordinates correspond to a local maximum (if any) and which correspond to a local minimum (if any). (b) Find r′(x) when r(x) = ∫_0^x tan h(t) dt.

4. (32 pts) Consider s(x) = e^2x⁄3 −e^2x . (a) Determine s′(1). (Your final answer should be in terms of e) (b) Determine the inverse of s(x). Be sure to label your final answer as s−1(x). (You may assume without proof that s(x) is one-to-one) (c) Determine all horizontal asymptotes of s(x). Justify each with the appropriate limit. (d) Determine all vertical asymptotes of s(x). Justify each with the appropriate limit.

5. (20 pts) Assume f and g are differentiable for all x, and we know the following values of f, f′, g, and g′. (a) Determine the linearization of y = f(x) at x = 1. (b) Use your answer from (a) to approximate f (2) . (c) Determine (f ◦g)'(4).

6. (26 points) The following problems are standalone: (a) The rate of change of atmospheric pressure, P, with respect to the elevation, h, is proportional to P. That is, dP/dh = -kP. Assume the pressure at sea level is 18 pounds per square inch and the pressure at an elevation of 15,000 feet is 6 pounds per square inch. What would be the pressure at an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level? (b) A girl walks along a straight path at a speed of 3 feet per second. A searchlight is located on the ground 9 feet from the path and is kept focused on the girl. At what rate is the searchlight rotating when the girl is 12 feet from the point on the path closest to the searchlight?
