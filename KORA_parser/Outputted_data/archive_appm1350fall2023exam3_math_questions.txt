2. An object moves along an axis starting at time t = It moves with acceleration sin(t) meters per second squared with an initial velocity of 3 meters per second and an initial position of 2. Find the position of this object at t = 3π / 2 (Provide an exact answer in terms of π. Do not round or approximate your final ).

    Consider the integral ∫ 2 0 x^3. In this problem, you will evaluate this integral in two different Evaluate this integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2 (also known as the Evaluation Theorem). Separately, write the integral as the limit of a right-hand Riemann sum using n rectangles of equal Evaluate this sum and limit without using your work from (i).

3. What is the x-value of the only zero of f? (Note: The only zero of f is shown in the above)

    With x1 = -2, after one iteration of Newton’s Method will x2 be closer to or farther away from the zero in part (a)? Answer ‘closer’ or ‘’
   
    Give an x-value x1 for which Newton’s method definitely will not 
   
    With x1 = 3, what will lim n→∞xn equal when x1 = 3? (That is, with an initial guess of x1 = 3 and repeated application of Newton’s Method, to what value will the xn’s approach?)
   
4. Consider the function f(x) defined over [0, 10] that is graphed The graph consists of three line segments and two quarter 

    Approximate ∫ 10 0 f(x)dx by using five rectangles of equal width with the righthand endpoint.
   
    Determine the exact value of ∫ 10 0 f(x).

5. Using the grid below, sketch the graph of a single function, y = f(x) with each of the following:
   
    f(−x) = −f(x) for all x,
   
    f′(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 3

    limx→−∞f(x) = 2,

6. A box with an open top is to be constructed from a square piece of cardboard, 6 ft by 6 ft, by cutting out identical squares from each of the four corners and bending up the sides.

    What are the dimensions of the square you need to cut out of each corner so that your box has maximum volume? Include the correct units of measurement in your final answer. (Be sure you have justified that you have found the absolute maximum)
