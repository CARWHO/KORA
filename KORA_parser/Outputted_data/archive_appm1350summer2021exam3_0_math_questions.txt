1. (15 pts) In your own words, answer the following concerning some of the fundamental mathematical concepts in Unit Two or three sentences or a sentence and a brief sketch should be sufﬁcient for each of your (a) Suppose R 5 -5 K(x)dx = 0 for some continuous function, K(x). Speculate on a possible value(s) for R 5 -5 L(x)dx, where L(x) = (K(x))^2 + Explain why your speculation is (b) The area under g(x) = -x^2 + 16 is approximated as the sum of four, equal-width rectangles drawn beneath the curve using the left-endpoint method on the interval [0, 4]. Explain whether this approximation will underestimate or overestimate the true value of the area beneath g(x). (c) Consider a scientist using the Newton-Raphson method to ﬁnd the roots of the function h(x) = 1/3x^3 −4x −Explain why an initial guess of either x = 2 or x = -2 will not result in a convergent.

2. (20 pts) For each of the following, ﬁnd f, the most general (a) f′(φ) = φ −sin(φ) −1/π. (b) f′′(z) = z^3 - 1/√z + 

3. (20 pts) For each of the following functions, ﬁnd the requested (a) W ′′(x) where W(x) = R x sin(z)/z. (b) B′(r) where B(r) = R r^2/−r^2(9 −p4)

4. (25 pts) A subsurface oil storage tank suffers a breach in its protective clay Oil is now leaking from the buried tank into the surrounding subsurface at a rate described by the function R(t) = -t^2 + 10t + 3, where t is measured in days and R(t) is measured in L/The function R(t) has been estimated using a model ﬁt to data taken from the tank’s depth gauge every 12 hours. The leak lasts for 5 days before it is instantly sealed and the leak Environmental ofﬁcials need to forecast the impact of this leak on the surrounding wildlife and have tasked you to estimate how much oil has leaked. (a) Set up a Riemann sum for R(t) on the interval [0, 5] using N equally spaced sub-intervals and right. (b) Determine how much oil has leaked by simplifying your Riemann sum and evaluating it for the limit as N →∞. (c) Compute the total amount of leaked oil by evaluating the deﬁnite integral of R(t)—verify your calculation matches the one you found in part (b).

5. (20 pts) A particle is constrained to move along the X-axis, subject to a force producing the following acceleration: a(t) = -1/4t^2 + cos( 8/πt) + 10 m/s The particle begins its motion at time t = 0 on the origin with an initial velocity of 12 m/For any time t ≥0, determine the exact functions describing: (a) the particle’s velocity, v(t); (b) and the particle’s position, s(t).
