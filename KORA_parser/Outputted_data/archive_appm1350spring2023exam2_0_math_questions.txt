4. State the limit definition of the derivative for a function f(x).
5. Let f(x) = 3x2. Use the limit definition to find f′(x).
6. For the given f(x), find all values of c that satisfy the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem on the interval [−1, 2].
7. Let g(x) = 2 + 3/√x. Find the linearization of g(x) at x = what value?

10. Timmy leaves home at 8 and walks west toward school at 3/2 m/s, Lassie heads south to visit the dog park at 2 m/s. After 8 seconds, how fast is the distance between them changing?
11. Let h(x) = x2 - 4. Find the critical numbers of h(x). Use the First Derivative Test to classify each critical number as a local minimum, local maximum or none.
12. The graph of derivative r′(x) is shown. Among the x-coordinates a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, find the coordinates that correspond to:
- min r(x) at x =
