The mathematical questions from the given text are as follows:

1. Find all solutions to the following equation in [0, 2π]: √2 sin(2x) + 1
2. If tan(u) = 3/4 for u in (π, 3π/2), find sin(u) and cos(u).

3. The intensity of a light follows the inverse square law I(x) = k/x² where x is the distance from the light. If the intensity of the light at 3 meters is 20 lumens, find the intensity of the light at 5.
4. The function g(x) is obtained from the function f(x) = √x by reflecting across the y-axis, shifting to the right by 2, then shifted down by. Find a formula for the new function g(x) obtained by the transformations of f(x).

5. Evaluate the following limits or show that they do not exist:
