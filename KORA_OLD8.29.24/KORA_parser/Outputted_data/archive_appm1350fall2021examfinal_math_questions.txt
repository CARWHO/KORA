Here are the math questions from the text:

1. Consider f(x) = {2x + 1 for 0 ≤x ≤1, 4 −x2 for 1 < x ≤2}.
    (a) Sketch a graph of y = f(x).
    (b) Is f differentiable at x = 1?
    (c) Does the Mean Value Theorem apply to f(x) on [0, 2]? Why or why not?
    (d) Evaluate ∫ from 0 to 2 f(x) dx.

2. The planet N’Var has acceleration due to gravity of -12 meters per second. Suppose a stone is thrown from the top of a 42 meter tall building on the planet N’Var with an initial upward velocity of 36 meters per second.
    What is the velocity of the stone when it strikes the ground?

3. Determine the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum of f(x) = ex3+3x2 over [−5, −1].

4. Let y(x) = (1 + 1/x2)x.
    (a) Find the value of y′(1).
    (b) Evaluate lim x→∞y(x).

5. Find the derivative of y = x2 arctan(e5x).

6. Evaluate ∫ from 0 to √3/4 1/√1 −4x2 dx.

7. Evaluate ∫ from 1 to 2 sinh(ln x)/x dx.

8. Solve the following inequality: log10 (4 −3x) < 1. State your final answer using interval notation.

9. Suppose that f(5) = 1, f′(5) = 6, g(5) = −3, and g′(5) = 2. Find (f/g)′(5).

10. Evaluate lim x→0 (1/x ∫ from 0 to x sin(t2 + 1) dt).

11. A rectangle is growing, but its length is always twice its width. Initially, the width of the rectangle is 3. Two minutes later the width is 5. If the rate of change of the width is proportional to the width (that is, dw/dt = kw), find the rate of change of the area of the rectangle after ten minutes.

12. Sketch a graph of a single function y = f(x) with all of the following properties:
    • The domain of f is (−3, 3).
    • lim x→a f(x) = f(a) for all a except a = 0
    • f(1) = 0
    • f(−2) = 0
    • lim x→3− f(x) = ∞
    • lim x→0− f(x) = −∞
    • f′′(x) > 0 for x in (0, 3)
    • f is an odd function.
