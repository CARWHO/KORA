1. Support or refute the following: solving y′(x) = 0 will always produce the x value which maximizes the function y(x) on a given interval.
2. The function g(x) = x2/5 is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers, excluding x = 0 where g(x) is not differentiable due to the presence of a vertical tangent. Does this mean the Mean Value Theorem can never be used in situations involving the function g(x)? 
3. Consider: I just solved a related rates problem where a balloon was ﬁlling with air and I wanted to characterize the change in the balloon’s radius. My solution for the rate-of-change of the balloon’s radius was dR/dt = −4 cm2. Does my solution make sense in the context of the problem?
4. Determine the following derivatives: (a) dz/dt, for z(t) = (t3 −cos(t3)). (b) dy/dx, for y(x) = −7x2y + sin(x −y).
5. For this problem, let f(x) = x/(x2 + 1)4/3 . (a) Find domain of f(x) and any vertical or horizontal asymptotes. (b) Determine the intervals over which f(x) is increasing and decreasing and the extrema of this function. (c) Determine the intervals of concavity and the points of inflection for f(x). You can borrow this expression for the second derivative, if you need: f′′(x) = 8x(5x2−9)/9(x2+1)10/3. (d) Using the function’s characteristics you just found, sketch f(x).
6. The temperature of an ultra-cold gas in an experimental chamber is governed by the equation T(t) = −t3/3 + 3t2 −8t + 15, where T and t are measured in K and hours. (a) Using the Closed Interval Method, determine the absolute maximum and minimum temperatures achieved during this experiment and when they occur. (b) Suppose the energy contained by this ultra-cold gas, E(T), is determined for a given temperature by E(T) = kT 2 + E0, where k and E0 are gas-dependent constants. Determine the rate at which this gas’ energy is changing when the experiment reaches a time of t = 5h.
7. The intensity of optical radiation, I(θ), measured by a polarimeter is governed by Malus’ Law, I(θ) = I0 cos2(θ), where I0 is the intensity of the incoming radiation and θ is the angle between the instrument’s polarizing screen and the vertical axis. In this type of instrument, the angle θ ranges from 0 to π. Suppose θ is measured to be π/4, with a maximum possible error of π/12. For a radiation source of intensity I0 = 1360 W/m2, determine the following using differentials : (a) The absolute error in I(θ). (b) The relative error in I(θ).
