3. (16 pts) A dose of a painkiller is administered to a patient. Suppose the rate at which the drug is eliminated from the body is proportional to the amount present, and we can model the amount of painkiller in a person’s body by the function P(t) = P0ekt where k is a constant. The painkiller has a half-life of seven hours.
  a. Find the decay constant k.

  b. At what values of x does f have a local minimum value?
  c. On what intervals is f concave up?
  d. At what values of x does f have an inflection point?

6. (14 pts) Two particles are moving along a line. Particle A’s position is given by A(t) = t2 + 2 + 3 sin2(t). Particle B’s position is given by B(t) = t - 3 cos2(t). At what time are A and B closest to each other?
