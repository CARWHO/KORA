Here are the math questions from the text:

1. Suppose we know that the function f(x) is an even. Show that the function g(x) = sin(x) + xf(x) is an odd. Justify your answer.

2. Evaluate the limit: as x approaches 0 from the positive side of (1/x) - (1/x^2 + x)

3. The function h(x) = (3x + 1)/sqrt(8x^3 + 5) has a horizontal asymptote at which choice below? (A) y=0 (B) y= 3/2 (C) y=0 and y=3/2 (D) y=-3/2 and y=3/2 (E) None of these

4. Use the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate the following limit: as x approaches 0 from the positive side, sqrt(x) * cos^2(1/x)

5. Find the limit as x approaches 0 of [sin(3x) sin(5x)]/x^2

6. Evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of sqrt(3 + x) - sqrt(3)/x. 

7. Suppose g(x) = {x^2 + x, if x < 0, 1 -cos(x), if x = 0, sin(x), if x > 0}. (i) Find the limit as x approaches 0 of g(x). (ii) Show that g(x) is continuous at x = 0.

8. Consider the graph of the function below labeled as Graph A. If this function is y = f(x) then which of the following choices given below correctly represents the graph labeled as Graph B? (A) y=-f(x) -2 (B) y=f(-x + 2) (C) y=f(-x) -2 (D) y=-f(x + 2) (E) y=f(-x) + 2

9. Use limits to classify all discontinuities of: f(x) = (x -2)/(x^3 -2x^2). 

10. The function g(x) = (x + 10)/(|x| + 2) has two horizontal asymptotes. They are y = 1 and y = -1. Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that g(x) crosses one of its horizontal asymptotes on the interval [-10, 0].
