13. A squirrel clings to the trunk of a tree, and she sees a peanut on the flat ground some distance away. A straight line can be drawn between the squirrel and the peanut. If the straight-line distance between the peanut and the squirrel is 50 ft, and the angle between that straight line and the tree trunk is π / 6 radians, how far down the tree and across the ground must the squirrel travel to reach the peanut?
