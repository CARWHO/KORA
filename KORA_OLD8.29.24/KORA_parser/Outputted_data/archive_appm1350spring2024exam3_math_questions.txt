6. Suppose we want to approximate a solution to the equation 3x + 2 −cos(x) = 0 using Newton’s Method. Find the formula for xn+1 in terms of xn.
7. Assume that the acceleration of an object (in m/s²) at any time t is given by a(t) = 6t² - 8. Find the velocity v(t) of the object at any time t, if v(1) = 2 m/s.
8. A farmer wants to fence off a small field in the shape of a right triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is along a riverbank, and the farmer will not need fencing along this side. If the farmer wants the area of the field to be 50 m², what is the minimum amount of fencing they will need? Use calculus techniques to justify your answer.
9. Write the expression of ∫ from -1 to 2 of f(x) dx + ∫ from 1 to -1 of f(x) dx + ∫ from -3 to 1 of f(x) dx as a single integral of the form ∫ from a to b of f(x).
10. Suppose the velocity v(t) of a particle is given in the graph below. Arrange the following quantities in order from smallest to largest: (i) the total distance the particle travels from t = 0 to t = a (ii) the displacement of the particle from t = 0 to t = a (iii) the instantaneous acceleration of the particle at t = a.
