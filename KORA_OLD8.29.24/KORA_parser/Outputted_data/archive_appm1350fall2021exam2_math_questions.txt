Here are the math-related questions in the provided text:

1. Find the derivative of f(x) = sec(x^2).
2. Find the equation of the tangent line of x^2 + xy − y^3 = 7 at the point (−2, −1).
3. Determine the (x, y)-coordinates where y = x^2 √2 −x has horizontal tangent.
4. Consider g(x) = (√x + 2 for 0 ≤x ≤4, x for x > 4. Use the limit definition of the derivative to explain why the function g does not have a derivative when x = 0.
5. Consider a runner whose position function is s(t) = t^2 + 5t + 50. Suppose a measurement of time, t = 10 seconds, is taken with a possible error in measurement of up to 1 second. If the measured value is subsequently used to calculate the value of y = s(10), use differentials to estimate the corresponding absolute error and relative error in the calculated y.
6. Verify that the function f(x) = x^3 −6x satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem on the interval [0, 3], and find all numbers c that satisfy the conclusion.
7. Answer the following with reference to a function f which is continuous on [−1, 4] and the provided graph :
   - On which intervals is f increasing?
   - For what x-values in (−1, 4) is f not differentiable?
   - For what x-values in (−1, 4) does f have a local maximum? For what x-values in (−1, 4) does f have a local minimum?
   - On what interval(s) is f concave down?
   - Sketch a graph of a function f that corresponds to this graph of y = f′(x) and your answers.
8. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were riding together on their way to visit an old friend when the road diverged into two. Rosencrantz had a bike and took a road going North at 8. Guildenstern, on the other hand, had a motorcycle and took a road going East at 15. 
   - Write down an equation(s) that relates all the given information.
   - How fast is the distance between them changing after an hour?
