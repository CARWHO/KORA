1. Find the most general form of u(x) such that u′′(x) = sin x + x^3/4.

2. Consider a particle that is moving along a linear Let t represent the time in seconds, let s(t) represent the position in meters, let v(t) represent the velocity in m/s, and let a(t) represent the acceleration in m/s2. Suppose the particle is accelerating at a constant rate of a = 4 m/s^2, its initial velocity is v(0) = 2 m/s, and its initial position is s(0) = 6 meters. How many seconds would it take for the particle to move from a position of s = 6 meters to a position of s = 30 meters? Show the full derivation of your results (do not simply use a formula from a different course).

3. The rectangle shown has one side on the positive x-axis, one side on the positive y-axis, and its upper right corner at the point (a, b), which lies on the curve y = 5/(x + 2) - 1. Identify the point (a, b) that produces the rectangle with the largest area, and use the Second Derivative Test to confirm that your result is a local maximum value of the area.

4. Suppose Newton’s Method is used to estimate the value of a root of y = p(x) = 0.5(2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5). Write the expression for Newton’s Method for the specified function p(x). Your answer should be an expression for xn+1 in terms of xn. Use the result from part (a) with a value of x_0 = 1 to determine the corresponding value of x1. Determine the actual numerical values of the constants b and d, which correspond to horizontal tangent lines. Consider using each of the four labeled x values (a through d) as the value of x0 in Newton’s Method. For which of those choices would Newton’s Method fail to converge? List all that apply, and in each case, briefly explain why it would not converge.

5. Let f(x) = (x −1) sin x + cos x on the interval [0, π]. Identify all critical numbers of f(x). For which values of x is f(x) increasing and for which values of x is f(x) decreasing? Express your answers using interval notation. Identify the x-coordinate of each local maximum and minimum value of f(x) (if any). Use the First Derivative Test to classify each as a maximum or minimum.
