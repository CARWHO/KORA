1. Find all the intervals on which g(x) = 3x5 −5x3 is increasing or decreasing. Give your answer in interval notation. 

2. Find and classify any critical point(s) of f(x) = x + 2 cos(x), 0 ≤x ≤π/2. Classify the critical point using the 2nd Derivative.

3. The monthly production of a light bulb company is P = 4xy (in millions) where x is the cost of equipment and y is the cost of labor (in millions of dollars). The company needs to produce P = 1 million units. Which values of x and y will minimize the cost C = x + y? 
   (i) Is this a minimization or maximization problem? Write down a function in terms of the two variables x and y that you would minimize (or maximize).
   (ii) Use the given information to write an equation that relates the variables x and y.
   (iii) Now using optimization find the value of x and y that satisfy this equation.
