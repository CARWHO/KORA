Here are the math questions extracted from your text:

1. For f(x) = 1/x2 and g(x) = 1/√x + 2, identify the composite function (f ◦g)(x) and its domain. Express the domain in interval form.

2. The graph below depicts a function of the form y = h(x) = a sin (bx) + c. Determine the values of a, b, and c.

3. Evaluate the following limits. Support your answers by stating theorems, definitions, or other key properties:
   a) lim x→0 (tan(x)sin(2x))/x²
   b) lim x→9 (√x - 5 - 2)/(x - 9)
   c) lim x→0 (x⁸sin(1/x³))

4. Consider the rational function r(x) = (x² -5x + 4)/(2x² -8x +3):
   a) Identify all values of x at which r(x) is discontinuous. At each such x value, explain why the function is discontinuous.
   b) Identify the type of discontinuity associated with each x value identified in part (a). Support those classifications by evaluating the appropriate limits.
   c) Find the equation of each vertical asymptote of y = r(x), if any. Support your answer in terms of the limits you evaluated in part (b).
   d) Find the equation of each horizontal asymptote of y = r(x), if any. Support your answer by evaluating the appropriate limits.

5. For what value of b is the following function u(x) continuous at x = 3? Support your answer using the definition of continuity, which includes evaluating the appropriate limits. u(x) =
   {
   (x² -9)/(x -3), if x < 3
   5x + b, if x ≥3

6. The Intermediate Value Theorem cannot be used to guarantee that the equation v(x) = 2/x + √(x + 2) equals 0 for a value of x on the interval (-1, 2). Explain which condition for applying the theorem is not satisfied.
