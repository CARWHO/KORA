1. (21 pts) The following are related to the deﬁnite integral A =

   (a) Approximate the value of A using a Riemann sum with a regular partition of n = 4 subintervals and right endpoints (that is, determine the value of R4). Fully simplify your answer.

   (b) Find an expression for A. Express your answer using sigma notation and fully simplify your answer.

   (c) Determine the exact value of A by taking the appropriate limit of your result from part (b). Simplify your answer (No credit will be earned by using the Evaluation Theorem)

2. (23 pts) Parts (a) and (b) are independent.

   (a) Evaluate ∫ 4 -3 f(x)dx, where f is defined as f(x) = {2x + 4, -3 ≤ x ≤ 0, √ 16 − x2, 0 < x ≤ 4}. Fully simplify your answer. (Hint: Consider the relationship between deﬁnite integrals and antiderivatives).

   (b) Let g be a continuous function on [−3, 3] with ∫ 0 -1 g(x)dx = 4 and ∫ 3 0 g(x)dx = 9. Find the value of ∫ -1 -3 g(x)dx in each of the following cases: g is an even function, g is an odd function.

3. (24 pts) Parts (a) and (b) are independent.

   (a) Suppose the velocity function of a car is v(t) = 50 + 2t3 miles per hour between t = 0 hours and t = 2 hours. Determine the car’s average velocity during that time. Fully simplify your answer and include the correct unit of measurement.

   (b) Evaluate the following. Fully simplify your answers:
