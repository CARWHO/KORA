Here are the math questions extracted from your text:

1. Find all solutions to the following equation in [0, 2π]: 3 tan2(x) −1 = 0
2. If cos(u) = 1/4 and sin(u) < 0 find tan(u).
3. The function g(x) is obtained from the function f(x) = 1/x by reflecting across the y-axis, shifting to the right by 2, then shifted down by 3. Find a formula for the new function g(x) obtained by the transformations of f(x).
4. Sketch a graph of f and sketch a graph of g on the same axes.
5. Evaluate the following limits or show that they do not exist:
   a) lim[x→−2](|x + 2|/3x + 6) 
   b) lim[x→0]((4x cos(x) −3 sin(x))/5 tan(x))
   c) lim[x→1−](x2 − x + 6/x − 1)
6. Let g(x) be defined as,
   g(x) ={c, x = −1; x2 − x − 2/x + 1, x ≠ −1}, 
   where c is a yet-to-be-determined constant. Use the definition of continuity to determine the value of c that makes g(x) continuous on R?
7. Find the derivative of the following function using the limit definition of the derivative:
   g(x) = sqrt(x + 2)
8. Compute the derivatives of the following functions using any method you prefer:
   a) g(x) = −x100 + 2 sqrt(x3)

   c) j(x) = 1 − x/1 + x
9. Let f(x) = 1/x2 −k where k is some constant. If f(x) passes through the point (2, 1) find the value of k. What is the domain of f(x)? (Write your answer in interval notation). Find the equation of the tangent line to the function f at the point (2, 1).
