2. (20 pts) The graph below represents a particle’s velocity function v(t), and the corresponding position function for 0 ≤t ≤6 is s(t) = integral from 0 to t of v(u) du. 
  - (a) Determine the particle’s position at time t = 0 and at time t = 6.

3. (27 pts) Parts (a) and (b) are 
  - (a) Evaluate the following. Fully simplify your answers:
    - integral from 0 to x of (sqrt(3x2 + 1)) dx
    - integral from 0 to sin(3x1/3) of (x2/3) dx
  - (b) Suppose g(x) is a continuous function such that integral from 1 to 7 of g(x) dx = 10. Find the value of integral from 0 to 2 of g(3x + 1) dx (Hint: Apply u-substitution.)

4. (28 pts) Parts (a) and (b) are 
  - (a) Consider the function h(x) = cos2 x on the interval I = [0, π/2]. Determine the numerical value of the Riemann sum L2 for h(x) on I using left endpoints and 2 equally-sized subintervals. Write an expression for the general Riemann sum Ln for h(x) on I using left endpoints and n equally- sized subintervals. Express your answer using sigma notation.
  - (b) Suppose the following expression is a Riemann sum for a continuous function u(x) on the interval [−1, 2]: Rn = sum from i=1 to n of [(3i/n)^2 + 1] * (3/n). Find the numerical value of integral from -1 to 2 of u(x) dx by evaluating the appropriate limit of Rn. Do not use a Dominance of Powers argument when evaluating the limit. Fully simplify your answer.
