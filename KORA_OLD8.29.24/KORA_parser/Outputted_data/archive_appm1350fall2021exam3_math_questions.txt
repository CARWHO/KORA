(b) Evaluate ∫π/4 0 tan^5 x sec^2 x dx 
(c) Evaluate ∫2 0 [x^3 −2f(x)] dx where ∫2 0 f(x) dx = 1 
(d) Evaluate the sum: Σ(40 i=1) 5(i −1) 
(e) If the average value of h on [−2, 6] is 4, then evaluate ∫6 -2 h(x) dx 

2. (24 pts) Consider the function f(x) = x − cos(x): 
(a) Estimate the location of the x-intercept of f(x) by applying one iteration of Newton’s method with an initial approximation of x0 = π. 
(b) Use the Right Endpoint Rule with n = 3 to approximate the value of ∫π 0 f(x) dx 
(c) Find the derivative with respect to x of g(x) = ∫0 x^2+1 f(t) dt

3. (14 pts) Suppose that you want to build a cylindrical water tank with volume 9π ft^3. The cost of building each square foot of wall is $1, each square foot of the bottom base costs $6 and building each square foot of the top costs $2. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of building the tank.

4. (22 pts) Let g(x) = (x^2 −9)/(x^2 + 9) and define A(x) = ∫x -7 g(t) dt. 
(a) On which interval(s) is A increasing? Decreasing? 
(b) On which interval(s) is A concave up? Concave down? 
(c) Draw a graph of A(x) for −7 ≤ x ≤7 that clearly shows the x-coordinates of local extrema, inflection points, and assume ∫0 -7 g(x) dx = 0 to determine the x-coordinate of the critical point.
